            "desc": "Release Date: May 26, 2015 Unknown Mortal Orchestra has a very off-putting band name. Is this band a group of metal dudes who love orchestral music and old video games? One could surmise this or whatever else comes to the imagination. The truth is, though, that Unknown Mortal Orchestra isn't any of the things listed above.",

It sounds like the voice of a woman in her mid-to-late twenties but in reality, it’s projected from the throat of a nineteen-year-old. Kempner’s voice is not the only thing that is distinctive of her band, Palehound.",

Both bands have written some of the most refreshing songs I’ve heard in a long time. I’m genuinely excited about this album and I basically want to put it on repeat all day, every day. It’s just that good. The album is described on Soft Power Records’ website as a “total beast”, and rightly so.",
